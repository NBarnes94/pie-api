-useState always accepts two values:
    the state variable that's based upon the initial value we pass into it - in this case, undefined
    - a function defined as setSessionToken. setSessionToken is our means of changing the value of our state variable 

    -naming convention for the state variables is always what our state variable is called, and then 'set'____

    Naming convention for components is to stat with a capitol letter
